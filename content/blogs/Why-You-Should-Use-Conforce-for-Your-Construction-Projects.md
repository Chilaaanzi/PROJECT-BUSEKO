Conforce isn’t just a piece of metal — it’s the backbone of any solid Zambian build. Whether you’re laying a foundation in Lusaka or putting up a shopping complex in Kitwe, this reinforcement mesh brings long-term confidence to your concrete.

## Built for Zambia’s Harshest Conditions

Zambia's climate flips between scorching heat and torrential rains. Conforce is galvanized to resist corrosion, making it perfect for foundations, slabs, beams, and driveways. No wonder it's the go-to steel in high-humidity areas like Luapula and Copperbelt.

## Strength You Can Rely On

Forget cracks and shifting concrete. Conforce spreads load evenly across your structure, cutting down on expensive repairs later. Builders know: it’s better to reinforce right the first time than to rebuild.

**Pro Tip**: For homes, most builders recommend 6mm or 8mm thickness. For commercial work, go for 10mm or more. Always ask your supplier or site engineer for the right fit.

> Invest once. Build strong. Build with Conforce.
