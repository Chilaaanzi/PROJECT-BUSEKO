If you're starting a baking business or upgrading your kitchen, choosing the right oven is crucial.

- **Electric ovens** give consistent heat and better control, but can be power-hungry.

## Must-Have Features:
- Temperature control knob
- Interior light
- Two racks minimum
- Clear glass door

## Bonus Tip:
Brands like Defy and LG are common in Zambia. Always check for service availability before buying.
