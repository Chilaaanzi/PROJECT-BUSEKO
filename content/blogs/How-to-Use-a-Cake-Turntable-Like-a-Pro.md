A cake turntable isn't just for pros — it makes icing and decorating cakes easier, cleaner, and more enjoyable.

## What is a Cake Turntable?
A cake turntable is a rotating stand that allows you to spin the cake smoothly while applying frosting or decorations. It gives you better control and professional-looking results.

## Step-by-Step Usage:
1. **Place your cake board** on the turntable.
2. **Center your cake** to prevent wobbling.
3. **Start icing** while gently spinning the table with one hand.
4. **Use a scraper** or spatula for even, smooth layers.

## Tips for Zambian Bakers:
- Use a non-slip mat under the turntable for stability.
- Even plastic versions from local stores work great.
- Combine with a piping bag set for next-level decorating.
